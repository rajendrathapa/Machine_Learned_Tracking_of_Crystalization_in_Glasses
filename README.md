# Machine Learned Tracking of Crystallization in Glasses

## Overview
This is open-source project that leverages machine learning techniques to track and analyze crystallization processes in lithium niobate glass. This project aims to provide a tool for researchers and scientists in materials science to better quantify crystallization in glass materials using a machine learned approach. This is an improvement over the current trends of using bond-orientational order (Steinhardt Parameters). 

## Features
- Worked out using atomic positions trajectory file from DL-POLY3 (called HISTORY file).
- For the snapshots, the Steinhardt parameters and the coord/atom are calcuated using LAMMPS.
